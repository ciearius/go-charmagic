> Expect heavy refactoring of the top-level API.

Guesses the encoding of a text-file. Easy decoding into utf-8 for handling in your go code. 
Some are still missing, feel free to add them.

Tests are missing, encodings not supported and the top-level API not stable. This project is far from done and still a WIP.

Cheers,
